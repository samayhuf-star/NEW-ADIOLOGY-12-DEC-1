## Backend
- **Primary API**: FastAPI (Python) for ad generation and CSV export, using Pydantic for validation.
- **Background Processing**: Celery with Redis for asynchronous keyword generation and AI-powered keyword suggestions based on URL and campaign intent.
- **Ads Transparency Scraper**: Playwright-based web scraper (server/adsTransparencyScraper.ts) fetches competitor ads from Google Ads Transparency Center. Hourly cron job (server/cronScheduler.ts) processes pending requests. Results stored in PostgreSQL (ad_search_requests, ad_search_results tables).
- **Edge Functions**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno/TypeScript) for health checks, payment processing, and campaign history storage.
- **Fallback Systems**: Python-based ad generator, local storage, and a three-tier save system (Edge Function → Database → localStorage).
- **Business Logic**: Automatic business type detection, intent classification for ad copy, service/product-specific ad templates, and Dynamic Keyword Insertion (DKI).
- **Ad Generation Guardrails**: All ad creation follows official Google Search Ads policies via `googleAdsRules.ts`:
  - **RSA**: 3-15 headlines (30 chars each, all must be substantially different), 2-4 descriptions (90 chars each), display paths (15 chars)
  - **DKI**: Proper `{KeyWord:Default}` syntax, single DKI per field, valid default text within limits
  - **Call-Only**: Exactly 2 headlines, 2 descriptions, 25-char business name, valid phone number (no premium rates)
  - **Uniqueness Check**: Levenshtein distance algorithm prevents near-duplicate headlines/descriptions
  - **Ad Strength Calculation**: Scores based on headline count, description count, keyword inclusion, uniqueness

## Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for user data, campaign history, subscriptions, and billing.
- **Caching**: KV store for edge functions, localStorage for offline data, and Redis for Celery.
- **Data Models**: Supports campaign structure (ad groups, keywords, ads, targeting), user profiles (subscription tiers, usage), and billing records.
- **Website Analysis Storage**: localStorage-based analysis service (analysisService.ts) stores URL analysis results (intent, vertical, CTA, seed keywords) for quick reuse across campaigns. Supports backend sync via API endpoints.

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Authentication Provider**: Supabase Auth with email/password, verification, and password reset. Signup is invite-only.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access for regular users, paid users, and super admins, with Row Level Security (RLS), API key authentication, CORS, and Content Security Policy.

## Super Admin Features
- **Documentation Manager**: Load existing documentation from Supabase, create, edit, and publish help documentation with rich text, images, and video URLs. Super admins can upload images as base64-encoded attachments and embed YouTube/Vimeo videos. Supports draft/published status for content visibility control. Data persists to Supabase support_tickets table with documentation type flag.
- **User Management**: Create, edit, impersonate, and block users
- **Template Management**: Manage templates, versions, and enable/disable status
- **Campaign Structures**: Manage campaign structure templates
- **Website Management**: Track deployed websites and domains
- **Real-time Expenses**: Load real expenses from APIs (Stripe, OpenAI, Supabase, Vercel, GitHub, etc.), parse Mercury CSV transactions, sync with service APIs. Uses realExpensesService.ts for parsing CSV and calculating actual usage costs. Removed all hardcoded/sample expenses - all data is production-real.
- **Support Tickets**: Manage user support requests and tickets
- **AI Usage Tracking**: Monitor AI token consumption across users
- **Database Admin (React-Admin)**: Full CRUD interface for all database tables using React-Admin + ra-supabase (MIT licensed). Access via /superadmin/db-admin route. Features include:
