# **GOOGLE SEARCH ADS: RSA, DKI & CALL-ONLY RULES**

---

## **1. RESPONSIVE SEARCH ADS (RSA)**

### **📏 Character Limits**

| Element | Count | Character Limit | Required |
|---------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Headlines | 3-15 | 30 chars each | Min 3 |
| Descriptions | 2-4 | 90 chars each | Min 2 |
| Display Path 1 | 0-1 | 15 chars | Optional |
| Display Path 2 | 0-1 | 15 chars | Optional |

**Display Behavior:**
- Google shows up to **3 headlines** at once
- Google shows up to **2 descriptions** at once
- Headlines separated by "|" (pipe)
- 3rd headline may not show on mobile devices
- Google automatically tests combinations

### **✅ RSA Requirements**

**Uniqueness:**
- All 3+ headlines must be substantially different
- All 2+ descriptions must be substantially different
- No duplicate or near-duplicate content
- Variations must provide different information

**Example of GOOD Headlines:**
```
1. "24/7 Emergency Plumbing Service"
2. "Licensed Plumbers | Same Day Service"
3. "Free Estimates on All Repairs"
```

**Example of BAD Headlines (Too Similar):**
```
❌ 1. "Emergency Plumbing Service"
❌ 2. "Emergency Plumbing Services"
❌ 3. "Emergency Plumbing Help"
```

### **🎯 RSA Best Practices**

**Headline Strategy (15 Headlines):**
1. **Headline 1-3**: Primary keywords + USP
   - "Emergency Plumber | 24/7 Available"
   - "Same-Day Plumbing Repairs"
   - "Licensed & Insured Plumbers"

2. **Headline 4-6**: Benefits & Offers
   - "Free Estimates | No Hidden Fees"
   - "Save 20% on First Service"
   - "Satisfaction Guaranteed"

3. **Headline 7-9**: Location & Urgency
   - "Serving [City Name] Since 2010"
   - "Fast Response Time | Call Now"
   - "Open 24/7 Including Weekends"

4. **Headline 10-12**: Social Proof
   - "500+ 5-Star Reviews"
   - "Trusted by 10,000+ Homeowners"
   - "Award-Winning Service"

5. **Headline 13-15**: Specific Services
   - "Leak Repair Specialists"
   - "Drain Cleaning & Unclogging"
   - "Water Heater Installation"

**Description Strategy (4 Descriptions):**
1. **Description 1**: Primary value proposition (90 chars)
   - "Need emergency plumbing? Our licensed plumbers arrive fast with upfront pricing. Call now!"

2. **Description 2**: Benefits + CTA (90 chars)
   - "Same-day service, free estimates, and satisfaction guaranteed. Available 24/7 for emergencies."

3. **Description 3**: Credentials + Trust (90 chars)
   - "Licensed, bonded & insured. Over 15 years serving [City]. No job too big or too small."

4. **Description 4**: Specific offer (90 chars)
   - "Get $50 off your first service. Expert repairs on all plumbing systems. Book online today!"

### **📌 RSA Pinning Feature**

**What is Pinning?**
- Forces a headline/description to appear in specific position
- Reduces flexibility but ensures key messaging

**Pinning Rules:**
- Can pin headlines to Position 1, 2, or 3
- Can pin descriptions to Position 1 or 2
- Each position can have multiple pinned assets (Google chooses best)
- Unpinned assets fill remaining positions

**When to Pin:**
```
✅ Legal disclaimers that must show
✅ Brand name in Headline 1
✅ Critical promotional offer
✅ Location requirement (local ads)

❌ Don't over-pin (reduces performance)
❌ Don't pin all assets (defeats RSA purpose)
```

**Example Pinning Strategy:**
```
Headline 1 (Pinned): "Emergency Plumber | [Brand Name]"
Headline 2 (Unpinned): Let Google optimize
Headline 3 (Unpinned): Let Google optimize
Description 1 (Pinned): Required legal disclaimer
Description 2 (Unpinned): Let Google optimize
```

### **🚫 RSA Prohibited Practices**

❌ Repeating same keywords across all headlines
❌ Using similar headlines with minor variations
❌ Keyword stuffing in descriptions
❌ Creating headlines that only work in specific orders
❌ Headlines that rely on other headlines for context
❌ Incomplete sentences expecting continuation

### **⚡ RSA Performance Tips**

**Asset Rating System:**
- Google rates each asset: Poor, Good, Excellent
- Aim for "Good" or "Excellent" on all assets
- Replace "Poor" performing assets
- Monitor in Ad Strength indicator

**Ad Strength Levels:**
- Incomplete
- Poor
- Average
- Good
- Excellent (target this)

**How to Improve Ad Strength:**
✅ Add more unique headlines (aim for 10-15)
✅ Add more unique descriptions (aim for 4)
✅ Include keywords in headlines
✅ Differentiate messaging
✅ Use all available characters
✅ Add relevant ad extensions

---

## **2. DYNAMIC KEYWORD INSERTION (DKI)**

### **📏 DKI Syntax & Rules**

**Basic Format:**
```
{KeyWord:Default Text}
```

**Capitalization Options:**

| Syntax | Output Example | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| `{keyword:...}` | emergency plumber | All lowercase |
| `{Keyword:...}` | Emergency plumber | First word capital |
| `{KeyWord:...}` | Emergency Plumber | Each word capital |
| `{KEYWord:...}` | EMERGENCY Plumber | First letters caps |

### **✅ DKI Requirements**

**Default Text Rules:**
- Default text must fit within character limits
- Must be within 30 chars for headlines
- Must be within 90 chars for descriptions
- Default shows when keyword doesn't fit
- Default shows when keyword violates policy

**Example:**
```
Headline: "Buy {Keyword:Running Shoes} Online"

When user searches "nike running shoes":
Shows: "Buy Nike Running Shoes Online" (26 chars ✅)

When user searches "high-performance marathon training shoes":
Shows: "Buy Running Shoes Online" (24 chars - default used)
```

### **🎯 DKI Best Practices**

**Where to Use DKI:**

✅ **Good Placements:**
```
Headline 1: "{Keyword:Plumbing Service} in [City]"
Headline 2: "Expert {Keyword:Plumbers} Available 24/7"
Description: "Need {Keyword:plumbing repair}? Call us today for fast service."
```

❌ **Bad Placements:**
```
❌ Business name field
❌ Display path (unreliable)
❌ Multiple DKI in same ad element
❌ In the middle of a sentence requiring grammar match
```

**DKI Safety Tips:**

1. **Test Default Text First:**
   - Always ensure default text makes sense
   - Should be your strongest headline standalone
   - Example: `{KeyWord:Emergency Plumber}` → "Emergency Plumber" works alone

2. **Grammar Considerations:**
   ```
   ✅ GOOD: "Get {Keyword:Fast Service} Today"
   ❌ BAD: "Getting {Keyword:Fast Service}" 
   (What if keyword is "plumber"? "Getting plumber" is wrong)
   ```

3. **Character Planning:**
   ```
   Headline limit: 30 chars
   Your text: "Buy " (4) + " Online" (7) = 11 chars used
   Available for DKI: 19 chars
   Default: "Running Shoes" (13 chars) ✅ Fits
   ```

### **🚫 DKI Prohibited Practices**

❌ **Will Result in Default Text Showing:**
- Keyword contains prohibited content
- Keyword contains excessive punctuation
- Keyword is all caps (when using {keyword})
- Keyword doesn't match capitalization rules
- Keyword exceeds character limit
- Keyword contains symbols (@, *, #, etc.)

**Example of Violations:**
```
User search: "CHEAP PLUMBER!!!"
Your DKI: "{Keyword:Affordable Plumber}"
Result: Shows "Affordable Plumber" (policy violation in search)

User search: "best emergency plumbing services available"
Your DKI: "{Keyword:Plumber}" in 30-char headline
Result: Shows "Plumber" (search term too long)
```

### **⚠️ DKI Limitations**

**Does NOT Work:**
- Cannot use multiple DKI in same text field
- Cannot nest DKI within DKI
- Cannot use in sitelink extensions
- Cannot use in structured snippets
- Limited control over exact output

**Quality Concerns:**
- Can create awkward ad copy
- May insert irrelevant long-tail keywords
- Can reduce ad relevance if mismatched
- May trigger policy violations from user searches

### **🎯 DKI Strategy Examples**

**E-commerce:**
```
Headline: "Shop {Keyword:Designer Bags} Online"
Description: "Huge selection of {keyword:bags}. Free shipping on orders over $50. Shop now!"
```

**Local Services:**
```
Headline: "{Keyword:Plumbing Service} in Chicago"
Description: "Need {keyword:plumbing repairs}? Our licensed team offers same-day service. Call now!"
```

**B2B Services:**
```
Headline: "{Keyword:CRM Software} for Enterprise"
Description: "Powerful {keyword:customer management} solution. Start your free trial today."
```

### **📊 When to Use vs. Avoid DKI**

**✅ Use DKI When:**
- You have large keyword lists
- Products/services have clear names
- Search terms are consistent
- You need scale across SKAGs
- Keywords match naturally in sentences

**❌ Avoid DKI When:**
- Brand-focused campaigns
- Keywords require specific grammar
- You need full creative control
- Running small, tightly targeted campaigns
- Industry terms need specific positioning

### **🎯 Call-Only Optimization**

**Call Extensions vs Call-Only Ads:**

| Feature | Call Extension | Call-Only Ad |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Device | All devices | Mobile only |
| Click behavior | Click = website OR call button | Click = call |
| Format | Added to existing ad | Standalone ad |
| Use case | Dual objective | Call-focused only |

**When to Use Call-Only:**
✅ Emergency services (plumber, locksmith, towing)
✅ Appointment booking (doctor, dentist, salon)
✅ High-value consultations (lawyer, financial advisor)
✅ Phone orders preferred (restaurants, delivery)
✅ Complex services requiring discussion

**When NOT to Use Call-Only:**

### **📞 Call Tracking Best Practices**

**Requirements for Success:**
- Implement call tracking numbers
- Set up call forwarding properly
- Configure business hours accurately
- Train staff to handle Google Ads calls
- Record calls for quality assurance

**Call Tracking Setup:**
```
1. Use dynamic call tracking numbers
2. Configure forwarding to main line
3. Set up voicemail for after-hours
4. Enable call recording (with disclosure)
5. Track conversion in Google Ads
```

**Conversion Tracking:**
- Set minimum call length (e.g., 60 seconds)
- Count only first-time callers (optional)
- Track during business hours only
- Exclude hang-ups and wrong numbers

### **⏰ Call Schedule Settings**

**Ad Scheduling:**
```
✅ GOOD:
Monday-Friday: 8 AM - 6 PM (business hours)
Saturday: 9 AM - 3 PM (limited hours)
Sunday: Paused (closed)

❌ BAD:
Running 24/7 when business closed
No voicemail or after-hours message
Wrong timezone configuration
```

**After-Hours Strategy:**
- Pause ads when closed OR
- Use voicemail with callback promise
- Adjust bids lower after hours
- Clear messaging about availability

### **🚫 Call-Only Prohibited Practices**

❌ Premium-rate phone numbers (900, 976)
❌ Phone numbers that don't route to business
❌ Automatic pre-recorded messages without option to speak to person
❌ Phone numbers requiring payment to call
❌ Misleading availability claims

**Example Violations:**
```
❌ "24/7 Available" but phone only answered 9-5

❌ Phone rings to competitor
❌ Automated system with no human option
```

### **📊 Call-Only Performance Metrics**

5. **Call Quality** - % of qualified leads

**Optimization Benchmarks:**
```
Good CTR: 8-15% (higher than regular search ads)
Average Call Duration: 2-5 minutes
Conversion Rate: 10-30% depending on industry
Call Quality: 60%+ qualified leads
```

### **💡 Call-Only Creative Tips**

```

**Offers in Call-Only:**

```

### **📱 Mobile-Specific Considerations**

- Want fast solutions

**Copy Adjustments for Mobile:**
