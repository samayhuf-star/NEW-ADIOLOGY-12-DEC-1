        question: "How do I create my first campaign?",
        answer: "Click 'Campaign Builder' in the navigation menu, then follow the 5-step wizard. Start by selecting your campaign structure (SKAG, STAG, or Mix), then generate keywords, create ads, set geo-targeting, and finally review and export your campaign."
    },
    {
        question: "What are SKAG, STAG, and Mix structures?",
        answer: "SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Group) creates one ad group per keyword for maximum relevance. STAG (Single Theme Ad Group) groups related keywords together. Mix combines both approaches based on your keywords. For most campaigns, we recommend Mix structure."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI keyword generation work?",
        answer: "We use Google's Gemini AI to expand your seed keywords into 100-300 relevant variations. Enter 3-5 core keywords, and the AI generates related terms, questions, locations, and modifiers. If AI is unavailable, we use a local fallback algorithm so you're never blocked."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I generate negative keywords automatically?",
        answer: "Yes! In the Keyword Planner, click the 'Generate 500-1000' button next to the Negative Keywords field. This generates a comprehensive list of 500-1000 common negative keywords covering jobs, reviews, informational queries, and more."
    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between Broad, Phrase, and Exact match?",
        answer: "Broad match (keyword) shows ads for related searches including synonyms. Phrase match (\"keyword\") shows ads for searches containing the keyword phrase. Exact match ([keyword]) shows ads only for that specific keyword or close variants. Use all three with negative keywords for best results."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I select keywords for my campaign?",
        answer: "After generating keywords in Step 2, click on individual keywords to select them, or use 'Select All' to choose all generated keywords. Selected keywords are highlighted in indigo. You must select at least one keyword to proceed to the next step."
    },
    {
        question: "What are Responsive Search Ads (RSA)?",
        answer: "RSAs allow you to provide multiple headlines and descriptions. Google automatically tests different combinations to find the best performing ads. You can create up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions, and Google will show the most effective combinations to each user."
    },
    {
        question: "How does Dynamic Keyword Insertion (DKI) work?",
        answer: "DKI inserts the user's search query into your ad using the format {Keyword:Default Text}. For example, if your ad says 'Buy {Keyword:Shoes} Online' and someone searches 'running sneakers', the ad shows 'Buy Running Sneakers Online'. Always provide default text in case the query doesn't fit."
    },
    {
        question: "When should I use Call-Only ads?",
        answer: "Use Call-Only ads for mobile-only campaigns where phone calls are your primary goal. They're ideal for emergency services, local businesses, appointment-based services, and high-value consultations. The ad only shows a phone number and prompts users to call directly."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I export my campaign to Google Ads?",
        answer: "Complete all 5 steps in the Campaign Builder, then click 'Export CSV' in Step 5 (Review). The campaign downloads as a CSV file. In Google Ads, go to Tools & Settings → Bulk Actions → Uploads, select your CSV file, review the preview, and click Apply."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I save my campaign and continue later?",
        answer: "Yes! Click 'Save Draft' in Step 5 to save your campaign to history. Access it anytime from the History menu to continue editing or export again."
    },
    {
        question: "What do I do if I see 'Backend unavailable' messages?",
        answer: "This is normal! It means the AI service is temporarily unavailable, and the system is using local fallback generation. Your workflow continues uninterrupted with slightly different keyword suggestions. The quality is still excellent for most use cases."
    },
    {
        question: "How many keywords should I generate?",
        answer: "Start with 100-300 keywords for most campaigns. You can click 'Append More Keywords' to generate additional keywords if needed. Too many keywords can make campaign management difficult, so focus on quality over quantity."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I edit keywords after generation?",
        answer: "Generated keywords cannot be edited individually in the tool. Instead, export your campaign CSV and edit keywords in Excel/Google Sheets before importing to Google Ads. Alternatively, regenerate keywords with different seeds and negative keywords."
    },
    {
        question: "What character limits apply to ads?",
        answer: "RSA Headlines: 30 characters each (up to 15). RSA Descriptions: 90 characters each (up to 4). Display URL paths: 15 characters each. Call-Only ads have the same limits. The platform automatically validates these limits."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I export my campaign to CSV?",
        answer: "Use the CSV Export tool from the main menu. After building your campaign, you can export it directly to Google Ads Editor format. The export includes all campaign settings, ad groups, keywords, ads, and targeting information."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I target specific locations?",
        answer: "Yes! In Step 4 (Geo Targeting), select your target country and choose targeting by states, cities, or ZIP codes. You can enter specific locations manually or use preset ZIP code lists for major metros."
    },
    {
        question: "What file formats are supported for export?",
        answer: "We export in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, which is the standard format for Google Ads bulk uploads. The CSV is UTF-8 encoded and follows Google Ads' import specifications."
    },
    {
        question: "Is my campaign data secure?",
        answer: "Yes! All data is encrypted in transit and stored securely in your account only. We never share your campaign data with third parties. You can delete your campaigns from history at any time."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI integration work?",
        answer: "The platform handles all AI integrations behind the scenes. All AI-powered features like keyword generation and ad creation work automatically without requiring any API keys from users."
